# 🧠 Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to help companies **understand and anticipate customer behavior** in order to improve retention and reduce churn (customer departure).  
It combines **unsupervised** and **supervised** machine learning techniques to:
- **Segment customers** into homogeneous groups based on their characteristics and behavior.
- **Predict customer churn** using classification models.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### 1. Customer Segmentation
Group customers into similar clusters based on their profiles and behaviors using:
- **K-protoype**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**

### 2. Churn Prediction
Predict whether a customer is likely to leave or stay using:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **XGboost**
- **Random Forest**

---

## 📊 Dataset

### Sources
Public datasets such as:
- *Telco Customer Churn Dataset*

### Typical Variables
- **Customer Info:** age, gender, income, profession, subscription type, etc.  
- **Behavioral Data:** purchase history or service usage  
- **Churn Indicator:** whether the customer has churned or not  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- Cleaned datasets  
- Well-documented Jupyter Notebooks  
- Visualizations (clustering and model results)  
- Final analytical report  
- Presentation slides (optional)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data manipulation  
  - `scikit-learn` → Machine learning models  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Data visualization  
  - `imbalanced-learn` → Handle class imbalance  

---

## 🚫 Constraints
- Use **only classical ML algorithms** (no deep learning)  
- Apply **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**  
- Follow good coding and documentation practices  
- Maintain a **consistent weekly workflow**

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
- Insightful customer segments to support marketing strategies  
- Predictive model identifying customers at risk of churn  
- Data-driven recommendations for improving customer retention
